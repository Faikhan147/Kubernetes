What is Deployment ?

It is a better version of ReplicaSet that allows features like scaling, updates, and rollback

Example:deployment.yaml
Let's say you want 3 NGINX pods with version 1.21. You define a Deployment like this


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
