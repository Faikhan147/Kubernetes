What is StatefulSet+PV+PVC ---> Called as Static Provisioning ?

StatefulSet is used for database pods where PersistanceVolume(PV) is used to define the desired volume based on our requirement we
define and Storage Class is used for dynamic volume as per user requirement request PersistanceVolumeCliam(PVC) is used to connect
the PersistanceVolume(PV) to StatefulSet pods

Example: 1. PersistentVolume (PV).yaml


apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"  # Change based on your setup



Example: 2. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).yaml


    apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi



Examole: 3. StatefulSet (StatefulSet.yaml)


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: my-service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx
          volumeMounts:
            - name: data-volume
              mountPath: "/data"
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: data-volume
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
