What is Replication Controller
It helps to ensure the desired no. of pods are always running if a pod crashes it automatically creates new one

Example:replication-controller.yaml
Suppose you want always 3 NGINX pods running. You define a ReplicationController like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx-controller
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
